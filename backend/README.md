# Backend

The data ingestion pipeline for Tennis Scorigami is not included in this public repository.

It handles ETL processing of tennis match data from multiple sources (Sackmann datasets, SportRadar API) into our PostgreSQL database. This code is kept private to protect the intellectual property behind the project.

If you have questions about the data pipeline or are interested in collaborating, feel free to open an issue.
